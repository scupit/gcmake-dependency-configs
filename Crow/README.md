# Crow

A C++ HTTP/Websocket web service framework.

## Must use the master branch

**You must use the `master` branch, otherwise the dep configuration will not work.**
The current release (as of writing this README) is
[v1.0+5 Security Patch](https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow/releases/tag/v1.0%2B5) on August 24th.
That release depends on Boost, while the master branch doesn't.

That being said, the coming release (after *v1.0+5*) would be able to be used.
