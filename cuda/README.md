# CUDA
<!-- TODO: I Need to write the post_load script which automatically installs these libraries with the project.  -->

This module represents the libraries associated with [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

It corresponds to a `find_package(`
[CUDAToolkit](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindCUDAToolkit.html) `)` call in CMake.

## Installation

To install CUDA, go to the [CUDA downloads page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and
download the latest release for your platform.
